# Logistic-Regression
This is to understand the basic concepts of Logistic Regression and the associate example with the code and the analysis of the same
Logistic Regression is a classification type model which uses Linear Regression concept under the hood and that is why it is called as Logistic Regression.
It uses the Gradient Disscent Algorithm by which after a best fit line, it tries to get the coefficient values and minimizes the error.
It then undergoes Sigmoid Transformation to get the curve in the positive range by using the Euler's coefficient.
The S curve will go through a series of adjustments and the log loss function will be used to get the minimum error at which the algorithm can say that the sum of squared error is the minimum and can fix that best fit line of surface where from where it would be classifying the things.
If the function is quadratic in nature, the errors will be in the form of a cone which will definately have one global mimima which would signify that the mimumum error condition has been reached.
